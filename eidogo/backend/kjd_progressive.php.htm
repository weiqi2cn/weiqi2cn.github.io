Some\nguidelines:\n1. Have support for a fight - A high position provides support,\na low position does not.\n2. Take the side with most value.\n2a. A juncture point for both sides is of great value.\n2b. A side where making territory is uncertain is of little value.\n3. Consider strategic balance.\n4. Get sente, if there are more big points on the board.\n5. If there are two variations with similar outcome, but one\nwith a ladder and one without, avoid the ladder, because you\ndon't need to risk an opponent's ladder breaker.\n\nHow to learn joseki:\nIf you don't know joseki or a specific joseki, which you want\nto learn, don't try to remember every single branching, you find\nhere. Look first for the main and correct variations, which are\nmarked out with a '*', and try to remember the most easy ones\nof them. You don't need to know each branching you find here.\nWhen you learn a joseki, look also for the follow-ups in the\nmiddle- and end-game.\nUse a new learned joseki in your real games, immediately after\nyou learned it, until you can vizualize it coming onto the board\nin a rush, without trying to stress your memory in search of\neach next joseki-move.\nIf something goes wrong or you want to know more, look up the\nvariations of deviations, special strategies, trick plays and\nmistakes here. To understand, why there are only for special\nsituations or mistakes anytime, compare their results with the\nresults of good variations in nearby branchings instead of looking\nat their results for themselves. Open this file twice to put\ntwo results beside each other on your screen.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKnown mistakes:\nSome variation references are wrong,\nIf you find a mistake in the content, contact me.\n","HA":"0","KM":"0","ST":"0","PC":"","SO":"","FF":"3","VW":"","GN":"Kogo's Joseki, Jeongseok, Di`ngshi` Dictionary","GM":"1","EV":"","CP":"see below","DT":"13.9.2007","_id":"1"}]}
